#Everything I've learned about Javascript

##Strings


In ES6, we can use template literals to print out variables in strings:
```
`${firstName} is my first name.`
'Michael is my first name.'
```

##Variables

Variables can be assigned a number of ways, but the best way is to use the 'let' keyword.

```
let quantity=200;
```
Using 'let' prevents variables from being over-written and is important for _____ coding standard, meaning, that immunability.

Variables can be functions, arrays, or objects.

```
let quantity = sumValue(){}
let ingredients = [value, value2, value3];
let scores =
```

#arrays


```
//converts a text string into an array
String.split(",");

//get a portion of an array
array.slice(1);
a.sort()
a.reverse()
a.push()
a.pop()


```
